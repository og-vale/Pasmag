The Pasadena and St Marys Action Group (PASMAG) is a local grassroots group made up of people who live, work or play in Pasadena and St Marys. Our journey began with four residents with a vision to achieve positive outcomes for our community by caring for our local flora, fauna and people, with a team whose combined knowledge and optimistic approach can accomplish results for the public good.

Our group has attracted over 135 members on Facebook who regularly contribute to discussions about our area. Our aim is to action solutions to current issues and to work on ideas in a proactive way.
